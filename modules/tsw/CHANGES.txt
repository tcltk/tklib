What is new in Tsw 1.1?
-----------------------

1. For compatibility with the (ttk::)checkbutton, toggling the widget's
   switch state by changing the value of the variable specified by the
   "-variable" option will no longer cause the script specified by the
   "-command" option to get executed.

2. For further compatibility with the (ttk::)checkbutton, invoking the
   "switchstate" subcommand with the optional argument now has no effect
   if the widget's "disabled" state flag is set.

3. Several further improvements in the code and the demo script
   "EditingOpts.tcl".

4. Improved the documentation by extending the CSS stylesheet used in
   the HTML files.

What was new in Tsw 1.0?
------------------------

This is the first release.  Thanks to Nicolas Bats for his early
testing and proposing the support for the "-variable" toggleswitch
option.
