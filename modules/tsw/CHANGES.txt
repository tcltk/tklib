What is new in Tsw 1.3?
-----------------------

1. Significantly improved the element creation:  Tsw now creates the
   trough and slider elements with the aid of generic procedures for
   arbitrary themes and theme-specific ones for a few built-in themes.

2. Added plugin capability:  Applications can now add explicit support
   for any theme by providing an appropriate command of the name
   "tsw::createElements_$theme".

3. Added support for the "-class" and "-style" configuration options.

4. Extended the description of the "-size" option in the reference
   manual by a detailed description of the dependency between the
   "-size" and "-style" options.

5. Added a detailed "STYLING OPTIONS" section to the reference manual.

What was new in Tsw 1.2?
------------------------

1. Added explicit support for the "droid" theme, which is the default
   in AndroWish, as well as for the themes "awarc", "awbreeze",
   "awbreezedark", "awdark", "awlight", and "plastik" (which "droid" is
   derived from).

2. Made sure that on Android the widget's behavior is adapted to the
   touchscreen as input device.

3. Improved the support for older macOS versions.

4. Worked around the fact that for some third-party themes, the
   retrieval of the root style's foreground color returns an empty
   string.

5. Guarded against a bug in the ttk::scale widget's "get x y" command.

What was new in Tsw 1.1?
------------------------

1. For compatibility with the (ttk::)checkbutton, toggling the widget's
   switch state by changing the value of the variable specified by the
   "-variable" option will no longer cause the script specified by the
   "-command" option to get executed.

2. For further compatibility with the (ttk::)checkbutton, invoking the
   "switchstate" subcommand with the optional argument now has no effect
   if the widget's "disabled" state flag is set.

3. Several further improvements in the code and the demo script
   "EditingOpts.tcl".

4. Extended the reference manual by a section about choosing between
   toggleswitch and (ttk::)checkbutton widgets.

5. Improved the documentation by extending the CSS stylesheet used in
   the HTML files.

What was new in Tsw 1.0?
------------------------

This is the first release.  Thanks to Nicolas Bats for his early
testing and proposing the support for the "-variable" toggleswitch
option.
